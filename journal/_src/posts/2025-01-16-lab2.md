Lab 2 Journal Entry

This lab was all about learning new tools and concepts, especially with Git and Racket. Everything we did was new for me, and I found it challenging at first, but by the end of the lab, I felt more confident. Here, I will explain what I learned, the exercises we worked on, and what I found interesting or difficult.

What New Concepts Did I Learn?
I learned many new concepts in this lab. The most important were:

New Git Commands:

git diff --cached: This showed me changes that were staged but not yet committed. It helped me review my work before committing.
git diff --stat: This gave me a summary of changes, like how many lines were added or removed in each file.
git log --stat --summary: This command showed the history of commits, along with details about the changes made in each commit.
Racket Programming:

I learned how to write programs using the #lang htdp/bsl language in Racket. The way Racket uses prefix notation (e.g., (* 6 7) for multiplication) was very different from other languages I know like Java.
I also learned about testing functions using check-expect. This method made it easier to confirm that my functions were correct.
Cleaning Generated Files:

We used raco frog --clean to remove unnecessary files created by Frog. This taught me how to keep my Git repository clean and organized.
What Concepts Are Familiar?
Some Git concepts were familiar because I used Git in another course, CS2043 (Introduction to Software Engineering). I already knew basic commands like git add, git commit, and git push. But the new commands we used in this lab were much more detailed and helped me understand Git better.

The idea of writing and testing functions was also familiar, but the way Racket handles this was very new to me.

What New Skills Did I Practice?
I practiced many new skills during this lab:

Advanced Git Commands:

Using git diff --cached to review staged changes before committing them.
Cleaning up generated files and staging deletions with git add -u.
Reviewing the history of changes with git log and its advanced options like --stat and --summary.
Writing and Testing Racket Code:

I wrote my first Racket program using #lang htdp/bsl. At first, the syntax was confusing, especially the prefix notation like (* 6 7). However, after writing a few examples, I got more comfortable with it.
I learned how to define functions and test them using check-expect. Writing tests helped me think carefully about how my code should work.
Solving Racket Exercises:

I worked through several Racket exercises that made me think deeply about how Racket handles expressions and errors. For example:
In Exercise 0, we predicted the result of expressions like (* 5 3) and (/ 25 0). It was confusing at first to see how Racket reports errors like division by zero.
In Exercise 1, we used (check-expect (* 6 9) 42) to predict and verify results. This helped me see how check-expect works as a testing tool.
In Exercise 2, we defined functions like t1, t2, and t3. These functions used logic like or and and. It took me some time to understand how Racket evaluates these logical expressions, but by the end, it was clearer.
Blog Maintenance:

I cleaned up the Frog blog using raco frog --clean and verified it still worked with raco frog -bp.
What Specific Details Were Interesting, Surprising, or Difficult?
Interesting: The way Racket uses check-expect for testing functions was interesting. It was simple but very effective for small programs.
Surprising: The prefix notation in Racket surprised me. For example, writing (+ 1 2 3) instead of 1 + 2 + 3 felt strange, but it made sense after some practice.
Difficult: Understanding how git diff --cached is different from git diff was tricky at first. I had to test both commands multiple times to see how they worked.
Confusing: The Racket exercises were confusing in the beginning, especially when predicting errors for expressions like (/ 25 0). However, with some practice, I started to see how Racket handles errors and evaluates expressions step by step.
What Explicit Tasks Were Given?
We completed many tasks during this lab:

Using Git Commands:

Remove unnecessary content using git grep and clean up the repository with git add -u.
Verify changes using git diff --cached and commit them with clear messages.
Writing and Testing Racket Code:

Write a program using #lang htdp/bsl and test it in DrRacket.
Define and test the middle-of-three function, which finds the middle value of three numbers.
Work on Racket exercises:
Predict results and errors for expressions in Exercise 0.
Use check-expect to test expressions in Exercise 1.
Define and test logical functions in Exercise 2.
Cleaning Up Generated Files:

Use raco frog --clean to remove temporary files.
Rebuild the blog with raco frog -bp to make sure it worked after cleaning.
Reviewing Git History:

Use git log and its options to review commit history and verify changes.
Reading Assignments:

Read the documentation for Racket and Frog to understand how they work.
What Did I Learn About Myself?
This lab showed me that I can learn new tools and languages with practice and patience. Although I was confused at first, especially with Racket and some advanced Git commands, I managed to understand them by the end of the lab. I also learned that testing code and reviewing changes carefully are very important skills in programming.

Final Thoughts
Lab 2 was a great learning experience. I gained more confidence in using Git and learned the basics of Racket, a completely new programming language for me. While some tasks were difficult, like cleaning up generated files and working with logical expressions in Racket, they helped me grow as a programmer.
