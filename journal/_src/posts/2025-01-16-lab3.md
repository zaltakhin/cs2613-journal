Journal Entry for Lab 3


Lab 3 introduced several new concepts, skills, and tasks, focusing on advanced Git operations and deeper work with Racket using the DrRacket Stepper. Below, I will summarize everything I learned and the questions we answered during the lab.

New Concepts Learned
Multiple Git Repositories:

We learned how to clone a central repository into a scratch directory and work on it independently.
The purpose of this was to simulate how Git workflows operate in real-world projects with distributed team collaboration.
Git Pull and Push:

We practiced creating a blog entry in the cloned repository, committing it, and pushing the changes back to the central repository. Then, we pulled those changes back into the original directory using git pull origin main. This exercise highlighted the importance of keeping repositories in sync and how to resolve potential conflicts.
Test Coverage in Racket:

This was the first time we enabled test coverage in DrRacket. The goal was to ensure that every part of the program was covered by tests.
We discussed how Racket highlights uncovered code in orange and the need to write test cases that verify all parts of the program.
DrRacket Stepper:

The Stepper allowed us to observe how Racket evaluates expressions step-by-step. This was particularly helpful when debugging recursive functions.
Familiar Concepts
Git Basics:
Adding, committing, and pushing changes were familiar but were expanded to include working with multiple repositories.
Writing Test Cases:
Writing tests with check-expect was similar to concepts learned in other courses about unit testing.
Skills Practiced
Cloning and Managing Multiple Repositories:

Creating a scratch directory and cloning repositories taught me how to separate experimental work from the main project.
Using the DrRacket Stepper:

Running recursive functions through the Stepper provided a clear understanding of how Racket executes code.
Debugging Test Coverage:

I practiced interpreting the orange highlights in DrRacket and updating test cases to ensure full coverage.
Challenges and Observations
Understanding git pull and git push:

Initially, it was unclear how git pull merged changes from the central repository, especially when conflicts arose. However, the exercise clarified how these commands work in collaboration.
Recursive Function Debugging:

Fixing the my-* function in Racket was confusing at first. Watching the Stepper break the problem into smaller steps made it easier to identify errors in the recursion.
Test Coverage:

The orange highlighting in DrRacket was a bit tricky to interpret. It became clear that any uncovered code required additional test cases to ensure thorough validation.
Tasks Completed
Cloned a repository into a scratch directory and created a new blog entry.
Pushed the changes back to the central repository and pulled them into the original directory.
Fixed the my-* function using the formula
A x B = ( a – 1 ) x b + b 
Used the Stepper to debug the recursive function and observed evaluation steps.
Enabled test coverage in DrRacket and wrote test cases to ensure complete coverage.
Pushed all changes to the central repository after completing the tasks.
Questions Answered:
What is a Remote?

A remote is a reference to a repository hosted on an external server. It allows us to fetch, push, and sync code between local and remote repositories.
What is Merging?

Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch or repository into another. It often happens during a git pull.
What is a Conflict?

A conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes because the same lines of code were modified differently in two branches or repositories.
How Does the Stepper Work?

The Stepper executes Racket code step-by-step, showing intermediate evaluations and how recursive calls progress.
Final Thoughts
Lab 3 provided a deeper understanding of Git workflows and Racket debugging techniques. Working with multiple repositories showed how distributed teams collaborate, and using the Stepper eased Racket’s evaluation process.
