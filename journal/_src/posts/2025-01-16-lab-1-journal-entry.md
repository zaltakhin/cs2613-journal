Lab 1 Journal Entry

Introduction

In this lab, we learned about tools and skills that we will use in this course. The main focus was on setting up Frog to create a blog, practicing basic command-line tasks, and starting a Git repository. Some parts were new to me, like using Frog, but other parts, like Git, were familiar from my previous courses.

New Concepts
The most important new idea I learned in this lab was Frog, a tool for creating a blog. Frog is a static site generator, which means it can take files from your computer and turn them into a simple website that you can open in a browser. We used Frog to create a journal for this course.

Here are the steps I learned about Frog:

Setting up Frog: I ran the command raco frog --init to set up the blog. It created a folder structure with all the files I needed.
Creating a blog entry: I wrote my first blog post in a text file and saved it in the posts folder. This is where all blog posts are stored.
Building and previewing the blog: After creating my post, I ran the command raco frog -bp to rebuild the blog. This updated my website so I could see the changes in a browser.
Cleaning up the blog: The Frog setup creates a fake blog post by default. I learned how to delete it and replace it with my own content.
This was my first time working with a tool like Frog, and I enjoyed seeing how simple files can turn into a website.

Familiar Concepts:

Some concepts in this lab were familiar from my previous course, CS2043: Introduction to Software Engineering, where we learned about Git. In that course, we practiced:

Setting up a Git repository: Running git init to create a new repository was something I already knew.
Adding and committing files: Using git add and git commit to save changes in a project was familiar.
Pushing and pulling changes: Although I did not push or pull in this lab, the steps to prepare the repository reminded me of the workflows we practiced in CS2043.
New Skills Practiced

I practiced several new skills related to Frog in this lab:

Setting up Frog: I learned how to initialize a Frog blog and set up folders to store my posts.
Creating and managing blog posts: I practiced writing my first blog entry and saving it in the correct place.
Building the blog: I used raco frog -bp to update the blog and see my work in a browser.
Cleaning files: I deleted the fake blog post that was created during setup to make the blog my own.
These skills were new to me, and I found them useful and interesting.

Specific Details
Here are some things I found important or challenging:

Interesting: It was interesting to see how Frog can create a blog from simple text files. I liked the idea of using this tool for reflection and learning.
Confusing: At first, I was confused about where to put my blog posts. I did not know they had to go in the posts folder. After reading the instructions, it made more sense.
Surprising: I was surprised at how easy it was to preview the blog with raco frog -bp. I expected the process to take more time.
Difficult: During the setup, I saw some warnings when installing Frog. The warnings didn’t stop the setup, but I wasn’t sure if they would cause problems later.

Explicit Tasks
Here are the steps I completed in the lab:

	Command-Line Practice:
Created and deleted files and folders using the terminal.
Used commands to navigate the file system.


	Software Installation:
Installed Frog using:
raco pkg install --auto unb-cs2613
Installed the pygments Python library for syntax highlighting.

Setting Up Frog:
Initialized Frog with raco frog --init.
Created my first blog post and deleted the fake post.
Built the blog using raco frog -bp and checked it in the browser.

Git Repository Setup:
Ran git init to create a local repository.
Staged the journal files using git add.


Conclusion
This lab helped me learn how to use Frog and practice skills like creating a Git repository and using the command line. While some parts were confusing at first, like understanding Frog’s folder structure, I was able to complete the tasks with the instructions.
