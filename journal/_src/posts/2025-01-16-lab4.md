Lab 4 Journal

In Lab 4, I learned new concepts about recursion and worked with custom structures. I also practiced using Git to manage and save my work. This journal will explain what I did and what I learned step by step.

New Concepts Learned

In this lab, I worked with custom structures called Z and S. These are used to simulate numbers in a new way. Z means zero, and S means the successor (or the next number). For example, one is S(Z), two is S(S(Z)), and so on. This way of representing numbers was very new to me. I used these structures to create functions like addition, multiplication, and comparison.

I also learned about a function called sum-factors. This function finds all the factors of a number and adds them together. For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6, so the sum is 12. I wrote this function using recursion, which is a process where a function calls itself to solve smaller parts of the problem.

Familiar Concepts

Some concepts were not new. For example:

Testing: Writing tests for each function was something I already practiced in earlier labs.
Git: I used Git to save my work, just like in Lab 1, 2, and 3. I followed the same steps to add, commit, and push my work to the repository.
Skills Practiced

Working with Custom Structures:

I practiced using Z and S to simulate numbers.
I wrote recursive functions (plus, times, and compare) that work with these structures instead of normal numbers.
Using Recursion:

I wrote recursive functions to solve problems step by step. This helped me understand how to break big problems into smaller ones.
Writing Tests:

I wrote test cases for all functions to make sure they work correctly. This helped me find and fix errors in my code.

Using Git:
I saved my work by committing and pushing my ex11.rkt file to the Git repository. I made sure to include all the functions and test cases.
Challenges Faced

Understanding Z and S:

At first, I found it confusing to work with these structures instead of regular numbers. For example, zero is Z, one is S(Z), and two is S(S(Z)). It was strange to think about numbers like this, but I got used to it after practicing.
Debugging Recursive Functions:

Some of my functions did not work correctly at first. For example, I had issues with the times function because recursion can be tricky. I used test cases to help me find the mistakes.
Writing sum-factors:

The sum-factors function was difficult because I needed to check if numbers are divisible using the remainder function. It took some time to understand how to solve this problem with recursion.
Tasks Completed

I wrote the following functions:

plus for addition
times for multiplication
compare for comparing two numbers
sum-factors for summing the factors of a number
I wrote test cases for all the functions and ran them to make sure they worked correctly.

I saved my work using Git by committing and pushing the ex11.rkt file.

Conclusion

Lab 4 was challenging but helpful. I learned how to use recursion with custom structures like Z and S, and I practiced solving problems in a different way. At first, it was hard to understand how to represent numbers with these structures, but writing and testing functions made it clearer. I also used Git to manage my work, which is now easier for me after practicing in previous labs. This lab helped me improve my problem-solving and coding skills.
